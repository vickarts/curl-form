<h2>Use curl to send form data to multiple url's</h2>
<li>Clone repository</li>
<li>Upload to your PHP server</li>
<li>Update sender.php with vendor url's</li>
<li>That's it!</li>
<p>I included extra files to fully demonstrate the process. However, the two main files necessary for sending form data to multiple url's are as follows:
<li>index.html</li>
<li>sender.php</li>
